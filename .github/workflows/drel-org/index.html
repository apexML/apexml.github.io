        TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP
An experienced leader in the global/public health arena, I am skilled at conceptualizing the vision for international health and development programs, driving strategic direction, defining deliverables, aligning resources, and leading programs to successful completion every time. A dedicated Medical Epidemiologist, I believe in evidence based programing strengthened by my ardent participation in operations research over the course of my carrier and authored a number of peer reviewed research publications. I have deep concern and expertise in all global health concerns and have spent 27 years primarily working with and managing HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

      <p>
        As a program director and health systems strengthening expert, I understand public health program management and implementation. I have additional experience in national health commodity supply chain systems with a long and successful track record building and improving national supply chains in Sub-Saharan Africa. I have served as an advisor to government ministries and NGOs and fully understand the complex business challenges of startups, turnarounds, and organizational restructurings.

        My ability to facilitate partnerships and manage collaborations with global organizations (PEPFAR, USAID, CDC, US DOD, Global Fund/UNDP, UNFPA, DFID and others) has resulted in countless program successes and helped improve the lives of many persons throughout Africa.

        Over the course of my career I have served as a Medical Officer, Medical Epidemiologist, Project Leader, Research Director, and Program/Country Director. I am known for my turnaround capabilities. I have leaned on my single-most important core belief to drive program success: “I believe that nothing is impossible and, once in, I never quit.”
